## Core Features

### Emergency Detection System
- **Trigger Phrases**: 40+ emergency conditions detected
- **Immediate Response**: No LLM call for emergency cases
- **Safety First**: Always prioritizes user safety

### LLM Integration
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts for medical analysis
- **Conservative Responses**: Emphasizes uncertainty and professional consultation
- **Structured Output**: JSON schema for consistent responses

### Data Privacy
- **Anonymization**: Symptoms hashed before storage
- **No PHI Storage**: User data pseudonymized by default
- **Audit Trail**: Query history without exposing sensitive data

### Modern UI/UX

- **Clear Disclaimers**: Prominent safety warnings
- **Professional Look**: Medical-grade interface design
- **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states and error handling

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/symptom-check
Analyzes symptoms and returns probable conditions with triage recommendations.

**Request Schema**:
```json
{
  "user_id": "optional_string",
  "symptoms": "string (required)",
  "age": "optional_int",
  "sex": "optional_string",
  "other_info": "optional_string"
}
```

**Response Schema**:
```json
{
  "triage": {
    "level": "emergency|urgent|non-urgent|self-care",
    "message": "string"
  },
  "conditions": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "rationale": "string",
      "typical_symptoms": ["string"]
    }
  ],
  "recommended_next_steps": [
    {
      "urgency": "emergency|soon|routine|self-care",
      "action": "string"
    }
  ],
  "disclaimer": "For educational purposes only. This is not medical advice. Consult a licensed healthcare professional.",
  "asked_clarifying_questions": ["string"]
}
```

### GET /api/health
Returns the health status of the API server.

## Emergency Trigger Examples

The system detects emergency conditions including:
- Chest pain and heart-related symptoms
- Severe breathing difficulties
- Neurological emergencies (stroke, sudden weakness)
- Uncontrolled bleeding
- Severe allergic reactions
- Mental health emergencies

## LLM Prompt Template

The system uses a carefully crafted prompt that:
- Emphasizes educational purpose only
- Requires conservative, cautious responses
- Includes confidence levels and uncertainty
- Always recommends professional consultation
- Provides structured JSON output

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Hashing**: Symptoms hashed with salt before storage
- **Anonymization**: User identifiers pseudonymized
- **No PHI**: Personal health information not stored
- **Environment Variables**: API keys stored securely

### Safety Measures
- **Emergency Detection**: Rule-based safety checks
- **Medical Disclaimers**: Clear educational disclaimers
- **Professional Guidance**: Always recommend medical consultation
- **Conservative Approach**: Err on side of caution

## Deployment

### Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd backend && dart pub get && dart run bin/server.dart

# Frontend
cd frontend && flutter pub get && flutter run -d web-server
```

### Environment Configuration
Copy `env.example` to `.env` and configure:
- LLM API keys
- Database connection
- Security settings

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
cd backend && dart test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test emergency detection
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/symptom-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symptoms": "severe chest pain"}'

# Test normal analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/symptom-check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
