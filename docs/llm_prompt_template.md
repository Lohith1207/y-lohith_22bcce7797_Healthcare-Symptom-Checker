## LLM Configuration Recommendations

### Temperature
- **Recommended**: 0.0 - 0.3
- **Reasoning**: Lower temperature ensures more consistent, conservative responses

### Max Tokens
- **Recommended**: 800 - 1200
- **Reasoning**: Sufficient for complete response without excessive verbosity

### Model Recommendations
- **OpenAI**: `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4`
- **Anthropic**: `claude-3-haiku` or `claude-3-sonnet`
- **Reasoning**: Balance between cost, speed, and medical reasoning capability

## Safety Guidelines

1. **Always include the exact disclaimer**
2. **Be conservative in assessments**
3. **Emphasize uncertainty**
4. **Recommend professional evaluation when in doubt**
5. **Never provide specific treatment advice**
6. **Focus on education and awareness**

## Response Validation

The system validates that LLM responses include:
- All required JSON fields
- Valid triage levels (emergency|urgent|non-urgent|self-care)
- Valid confidence levels (high|medium|low)
- Exact disclaimer text
- Proper urgency levels for actions

## Error Handling

If the LLM response is invalid:
1. Log the error for monitoring
2. Return a fallback response recommending immediate medical consultation
3. Do not expose the error to the user
4. Alert system administrators
